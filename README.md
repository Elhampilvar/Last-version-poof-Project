Coding
Dear professor,
This is my lab assignment solving on a unit square, I had many problems with 'L-shaped'solution, there was many vague question in my mind. so I couldn't work on it. Sorry about that.
I sent you Some jupyter note books and the results are in pdf files. I also made a jupyter note book 
which is called "my point of view",and I analyze the errornorms and graphs.
Thank you for your understanding.
Best wishes,
Elham Pilvar
